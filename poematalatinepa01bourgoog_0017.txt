HYMN THE SECOND.

HOWarethy servantsblestssoLerd! η’

How eure is their desenee!
Eterne! wiedom is-their guide,
Their help· Omnipotenee.‘ Α

ln foreign realme and lande remote,
Supported by thy care ς

Through buming elimes 1 pass'd unhurt,
And breath'd in tainted air.

Thy merny sweeten'd every soil,
Made every region please,

The hoary Alpine hius it warm³d
And smooth'd the Tyrrhene neas.

Thiae, 0 my soul, devoutly think,
, How with affrighted eyes
Thou eaw’et the wide-extended deep
In all ite horrore rise !
