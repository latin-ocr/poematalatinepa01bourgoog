HYMNTHE THIRD.

ἀφ..- ’

WHEN rising from the bed of death,

O'erwhelm'd v'vith guilt and sear,
1 we my Maker sace t'o face,
Oh Ι how shalll appear!

1s yet, while pardon may be found,
And mercy may be sought‚

My heart with inward horror shrinh,
And trembles at the thopght.

When thou5 0 Lord, shaltstand disclos'd 1
ln majesty severe,

And sit in judgment on my toul,
01 how shall rappear! -

But ¹thou hast told the troubled ¹unul,
Who does her sius lament,
The timely {ribute ol hortem

⁴ Shall endlcsq woe prevent.
