HYMN THE FIRST.

αφ·-

WHRN sll thy mercles,'0 my God,

My rising mmmmm ι
Transported with the view l'm lost
ln wonder, love, and praise.

The gratitude declaro,

That glows within my ravish’d breul!
But thou canst read il there.

'rhy providente my lile sumniam,
And allmy wants fedrest3

when in the silent womb l lay,
lud hung upon the bresst.

’ Το ml my wesk complaints and eries¹
'l'hy mescy lent an easy
E’re yet my leeble thoughts had learnt
Το form themselves in prayer.
