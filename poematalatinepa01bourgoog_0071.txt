DEAR Chloe, while thu· beyond mensuro, J , ·

You treat me with doubts aud diadum,
Yon rob assyour yomh of its plenum,
And hoard up an oidvage of pain.
Your maxim, that love is still founded
On c'harmo that will quickly dewy,
You'll find to be very ὶΙΙ grounded‚
. When once you iudietates obey2 .

The love, that from' bea'nty is drawn, '
By kindneso you ought to improves , .
Soft looks and gay smiles are the dawn,
Fruition's the suu-shine of lovea

And though the bright beams of your eyes .
should be douded, that now are eu gay,

And darkness possess au the skies,
We ne'er can forget it was day. '

Old Dan-by, with Joan by his side,
You've osten regarded with wonder ς
He'u dropsical‚ she is sore-ey’d‚
Yet they're ever uneasy asunder.
