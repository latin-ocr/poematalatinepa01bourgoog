4 unm mm ΗΝ,

Unuumber’d comforls to my sou!
'l’hy tendes care beslow'd5

Before my infant heart concciv'd
From whom those comforts flow'd‚

When in the sliypery paills of youth
With heedlcss steps 1 ran,-

Thine arm uuseen convey’d me safe‚
And led me up to man.

Ἰ Through hiddmdangem, toils aud dealba,
1t gently clear’d my way ς

And through the pleasing mares of vice,
More to be fear'd thau they.

When worn with sickness, oft haut thou
With Ιιθαῃὶι4 Ιῐεῃςηνᾞ my sace3

And when ih sind andsorrowsjsunk, · ·
Reviv'd my‘soul with grace.

Thy bounteous hand with worldly bliss
Has made my c‘up run όέτς

And in a k'indhndl'sqithful friend
Has doubled all my ποτε.

Ten thousand thousand prehious gifts
My daily thanksemploy3

Nor ia the leasta chemin! hea'rt, -
That tastu those gissa with joy.
