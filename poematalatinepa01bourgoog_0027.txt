DESPAIRING beside a clear stream,
A shepherd sorsaken wne leid ι

And whfle‘a soloe nymph που ὴίιῑῑκωο,
Α willow supported his heae

'she winde, that blew over the plain,
'1⁸0 his eighs weh e eigh did rep155 ¹

And the brook, in retum to hie [niu.
Rau moumsuily murmuiing by.

Alae Ι silly swain that 1 was t
Thus eadly complaining‚ he αἰθᾶς
When first l beheld that sair sace,
'Twere better by sar 1 had died ι
She talk’d, and Ι blest the deae tongue ς
When she smil’d‚ 'twas a pleaeure too grenta
llislen'd, and cry’d‚ when she sung,
’ Wae nightingale ever so sweetl

How foofish wael to believe,
She could doat on so lowly a clown?
Or thet her fond beart would not grieve,
Το forsake the fine solk of the town?
