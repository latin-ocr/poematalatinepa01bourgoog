To think, that a beauty m gay,
So kind and ιο coustant would provo ι- ⁸.
Or go clad'hke our maidens in grey, '
Or live iu ο cottage on lovet

What though 1 have still to comptam?
Though the mussa my temptes have crown'd t
What though, when they hear my soft maim
The virgins uit weeping around t
Ah, Colint thy hopes are in vain,
Thy pipe and thy laurel resign ς
Thy false one inclines to a swain,
Whose music' in sweeter thau thiae.

Ant you, my companhous οο dem,
Who sorrow to see me betray’d,

Whatever 1 suffer, sorbeat,
Forbear to accuse the false maid.

Though through themide world 1 shou'd range,
’Τίο in vain from my fortune to fly= ¹

''l'was her’s to he false and to change ς ’
'Tis mine to he constant and die.

If, while my hard fate 1 sustam,
In her hreast any pity is found,

laet her come with the nymphs os the plain,
And see me tait low in the ground.

'the last humble boon that 1 trave, ι
1· to shade me with cypron and yews · ·

Ant when she tookt down in my gram - ¹
Let her own mother uheyhetd wat ttue. . ,
