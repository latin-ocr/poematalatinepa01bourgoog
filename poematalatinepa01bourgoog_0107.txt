GREAT name *, which in our rolls recorded stands,
Lenda, honours, and protocts the learned hands,
Accept thiu offering to thy bounty due, '

And Roman weallh in English sterling view.

Read here, how Britain, once despis'd‚ can taine

As ample sums, as Rome in Caesar's dayn
Pour forth as numerous legions on the plain,
And with more ¹dreadful navieu awe the main.

ss The king’s name stands first in the buttery-book of
Christ-Church‚ ³727.
