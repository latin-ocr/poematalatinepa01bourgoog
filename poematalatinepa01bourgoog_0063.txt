eme let ungo forth to the moad,

[οἱ ,ιιι nee how the primroses spring ς
*we‘u lodgeJn some village ou Tm. ”
And iove, where the feathored folkt sing.

How‘does my love pass the long day?
Due· Mnry not tend a few sheep?

‘Do they never mreleesly strny,

while huppily ‘ohe lies asieep? ’ “
'l'woed's murmura should lull her terent,
xind nature indulging my hiim =
To relieve the ³0st paint of my bremt,
l‘d ntea! an ambrosia! kaus.

'Tis she does the virgins excel„

= No beauty with hor can compare ι

Love's graces an round her do dwell ι
She’s spirent, where thounudu m sair.

Say, charmer, where do thy flockn otrayk
Oh Ι tel! me, at noon where they seed Ι

shall Ι κώ them on met-winding Tay,
Or {he pleasanter banks os the Tweed}
