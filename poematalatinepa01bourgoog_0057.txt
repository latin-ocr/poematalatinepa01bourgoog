SWEET WILLIAM’s

FAREWELL TO BLACK-EY’D SUSAN.

*ψ-

ALL in the Downs the fleet was moor'd,
The slreamers waving iu the wind,
When blackjey'd Susan came on board;
Oh l where shall l my true love find Ξ
Tell me, γε jovial sallors, tell me true,
Does my sweet Willlam sail among the crewl

william, who high upon the μνᾶ,
Rock'd with the billows to and lro ς
Soon as her well-known voice he heard,
He sighd, and cast his eyes below,
The cord slides swistly through his glowln'g handu,
And (quick as lightning) on 'the (lech he stands. ’

So the sweet larh‚ hlgh pois'd in air,
shuts close hh pinlons to his breast,
(tf, chance, his mate’s shrlll note he hear)
And drops at once into her nest. '
The noblenl captain in the Bsitlsh fleot,
night envy William‘s lips those kim met.
